[Learn to Swim - Basics of Buoyancy][1]

## breath control drills

blow bubbles in a steady stream, without any gap; the longer you can do that, the more breath control you have

practice: blow bubbles with your mouth

practice: blow bubbles with your nose

practice: bobbing = steady blow bubbles with your mouth and nose, then rise and take only one breath; repeat until it becomes natural

## float drills

hold your breath, that's how you float, the air in your lungs provides buoyancy

### front float

stand in chest-deep water

hands in front, opened wide-ish, palms down

bended knees

get a deep breath then get your head under the water

kick gently to raise the feet and body up, paralel to the surface of the water

extend body, straight line

feet opened wide-ish

head straight, low between the hands, looking down, at the bottom of the pool

relax your muscles

float

as if "breaking waves with your chest under water"

start to dismount by bringing the knees towards your chest

pull your hands back, in a large sweeping motion

drive down and straighten your legs until you land to the bottom of the pool

 as if "holding a jump"

### back float
